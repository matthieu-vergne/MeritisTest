# Starter

1. Present dummy code:
	- set of operations on 1 double
	- use some conf
	- keep it simple to focus on testing
1. JUnit Test
	- 1 test for all linears
1. Mockito
	- mock conf to control parameters
1. Hamcrest
	- more intuitive assertions

# Basics

1. Don't stop testing on first failure
	- Separate your tests
1. Distinguish broken vs failed test
	- Investigate from failures
1. Name your tests
	- Make the test report tells you what is wrong

# Start designing

1. Factor your code
	- Abstract the low level details
1. Factor your tests
	- List test cases rather than writing new tests
